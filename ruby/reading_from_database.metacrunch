# Metacrunch comes with a build in database reader based on the Sequel gem.
# For more information about Sequel: https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel
# Sequel support many databases. For this example we will use SQLite3.
# So lets declare the dependency to sqlite3.
dependencies do
  gem "sqlite3", ">= 1.3.11"
end

#require "sqlite3"

# To connect to the database Sequel support common connection URLs.
# Here we define a option that allows us to overwrite the connection
# URL default (sqlite://THIS_DIR/dummy.sqlite) from the command line.
options do
  add :database_url, "-d", "--database URL", "Database connection URL", default: "sqlite://#{File.expand_path(__dir__)}/../assets/dummy.sqlite"
end

# The provided dummy.sqlite database has one table (users) with one column (name) and holds 100
# dummy user records. To read from a database instatiate the build in database reader with a
# connection URL and the SQL select statement you like.
source Metacrunch::Db::Reader.new(options[:database_url], "select * from users")

# For every row that matches the SQL query the transformation is called.
transformation ->(row) do
  # For this example, we select the rows where the user name starts with "A".
  # Only these rows are passed to the next transformation.
  row if row[:name].starts_with?("A")
end

# Called for every row where the user name starts with "A".
transformation ->(row) do
  puts row[:name]
end
